# map-styles

This is planned to become a collection of styles to be used to compile maps for the very simple Garmin etrex 10. Since it has very limited storage, the styles have to be super simple.

## how to use

```java -jar mkgmap.jar --style-file:'/stylefile_directory' map.osm```

## Styles
- **etrex 10**: Simple style, only poi of special interest, polygons and cities.
- **simplest**: only lines: streets and rivers, for smallest size
